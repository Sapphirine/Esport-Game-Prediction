E-sports has caught capital’s attention the past 5 years due to the large volume of its viewership and its potential to generate profit. Among all, E-sports betting has been an inevitable hot topic of discussion. Researches estimated that E-sports wagering is expected to reach 13 billion in year 2020. Some large betting websites such as pinnacle has already seen 300% year over year E-sports betting volume growth. In addition, E-sports has also entered the main stream, proving its importance gradually. Among all the E-sports titles, League of Legends betting has received most attention because of its worldwide popularity. 

However, there’s one blank spot that most traditional sports betting has but not E-sports- that is in-play betting. Different from pre-match betting, In-play betting means players are able to bet during the match. This new type of betting has revolutionized traditional sports betting in the past, growing the market several times over in the space of a few years. 

In this project, we are going to solve the problem of in-game prediction of League of Legends matches, providing a win-lose prediction of two teams during a real time match. This will pave the way for odds calculation of in-game E-sports betting.
